The water that flows from Ilayang Palsabangon River is connected to Ibabang Palsabangon River and mixes into Tayabas bay. It is an extensive river. Some portions of the water are deep and some are shallow. Various groups of rocks that have been worn and rounded by the flowing water are called “river rocks” which are found in the river bed and come in a range of sizes, colours and textures. The fresh water is flowing in the river and due to its clear water, the river rocks can be seen clearly even on the deep part of it. The river is surrounded with lush plants, tall trees and brown earth soil that comes with a loamy texture. Due to the loamy texture of the soil near the area of the river, it causes the river to have muddy colour when the rainy period comes. Also, there’s a hanging bridge in the river that serves as a linking way for the residents of Brgy. Ilayang Palsabangon to the other side of the river.  The river is very accessible because the end of the concrete road of the barangay is beside the river.</p>
